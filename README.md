My solutions to the exercises in the book
"[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net)", 3rd edition

NOTE: I've tried keeping my solutions to the exercises within the context of the
chapter they're in (e.g. Avoiding `Array.reduce()` for the answer to
`countChar()` in Chapter 3 because Arrays aren't introduced until Chapter 4). It
seems, though, that I jumped ahead on using `Array.reduce()` as it wound up
being introduced in Chapter 5. M'bad.
